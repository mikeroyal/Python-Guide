#### A guide covering the Python programming language including the applications and tools that will make you a better and more efficient Python developer.

## Resources

[Python](https://www.python.org) is an interpreted, high-level programming language. 

[Python Developer’s Guide](https://devguide.python.org) is a comprehensive resource for contributing to Python – for both new and experienced contributors. It is maintained by the same community that maintains Python. 

[Azure Functions Python developer guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-reference-python) is an introduction to developing Azure Functions using Python. The content below assumes that you've already read the [Azure Functions developers guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-reference).

[CheckiO](https://checkio.org/) is a programming learning platform and a gamified website that teaches Python through solving code challenges and competing for the most elegant and creative solutions.

## Tools

[Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/) is a repository of software for the Python programming language. PyPI helps you find and install software developed and shared by the Python community. 

[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) is the best IDE I've ever used. With PyCharm, you can access the command line, connect to a database, create a virtual environment, and manage your version control system all in one place, saving time by avoiding constantly switching between windows.

[Python Tools for Visual Studio(PTVS)](https://microsoft.github.io/PTVS/) is a free, open source plugin that turns Visual Studio into a Python IDE. It supports editing, browsing, IntelliSense, mixed Python/C++ debugging, remote Linux/MacOS debugging, profiling, IPython, and web development with Django and other frameworks.

[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.

[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. 
 
[Web2py](http://web2py.com/) is an open-source web application framework written in Python allowing allows web developers to program dynamic web content. One web2py instance can run multiple web sites using different databases.

[IPython](https://ipython.org/) is a command shell for interactive computing in multiple programming languages, originally developed for the Python programming language, that offers enhanced introspection, rich media, additional shell syntax, tab completion, and rich history.

[GraphLab Create](https://turi.com/) is a Python library, backed by a C++ engine, for quickly building large-scale, high-performance machine learning models.

[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is a fast, powerful, and easy to use open source data structrures, data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language.

[PuLP](https://coin-or.github.io/pulp/) is an Linear Programming modeler written in python. PuLP can generate LP files and call on use highly optimized solvers, GLPK, COIN CLP/CBC, CPLEX, and GUROBI, to solve these linear problems.

[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is a 2D plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. Matplotlib produces publication-quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms.

[Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) is a simple and efficient tool for data mining and data analysis. It is built on NumPy,SciPy, and mathplotlib.
